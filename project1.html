    <h2>2018-09-26</h2>
    <p>Today's learning session wraps things up for this project.  It was a little harder to focus because I kept having thoughts about the coming-up projects and looking for resources to use for them.  That isn't totally outside the realm of what I should be doing, as if there are books and other reference material that will be needed I'll have to have them arranged and picked up before the next class so that I can jump in.  Still there is that feeling of "am I working on the right one" that I get whenever there are multiple projects going on in parallel.</p>
    
    <p>I did manage to finish my way through the SELinux section of the 2nd book.  There was a lot of overlap between the information it presented vs the previous book so in some ways that made it easy as I already had some mental framework to the things they were describing.  That also led to a temptation to skim however so there were some pages that I actually had to go back and read twice just to make sure I really was picking it all up.</p>
    
    <p>A few of the new things this time around were that it gave the location of the booleans in /sys/fs/selinux/booleans which is nice to look in there and see what they are all named.  There was also an audit tool they mentioned called ausearch which I had noted down as being mentioned in the other book.</p>
    
    <p>One other thing that this book described that was absent in the other book was a GUI tool for administring SELinux.  While that is a nice extra, I kind of suspect that it's not a part of the test as the other book didn't cover it.  On top of that, my test system where I was trying these things out did not have it avaliable, which is a situation that could happen in the real world too, so I think better to know how to work without it.  Still that section gave me some good info like where the booleans live in the filesystem so it was worth reading through.</p>
    
    <h2>2018-09-19</h2>
    <p>At the start of class today we talked about growth and fixed mindsets.  One thing that I got to thinking about was how some of the things that I put down as having a fixed mindset toward were things that I didn't really have any intention of adjusting.  That led me to think about how there is maybe a difference between having a fixed mindset about something vs. choosing not to go down a particular learning path.  Someone got close to this in the conversation too, talking about how in a job situation it could be troublesome if one of the workers couldn't stay focused and wanted to learn everything always.</p>
    
    <p>Growth mindset says we can learn about anything, but that is different from learning about everything.  We still have to exercise some discretion about the costs and benefits of individual learning paths and be aware of what is going to be the best use of our time.</p>
    
    <p>The necessity of choices and the idea of differing costs seems to lead back to the fixed mindset though.  If we say then that anybody can learn a topic, and that people experience a difference in the cost of effort it takes to learn about the same topic, could we then conclude that there could be a situation where a topic is prohibitively expensive to learn so that some people are effectively excluded from it?  That sounds like we're back at fixed mindset again.  Maybe the distinction is between impossibility vs impracticality.  While both may separate someone from an endpoint, impossibility denies that there is any road up the mountain while impracticality just says that it is a long and hard path that nobody has completed yet.</p>
    
    <p>Today I am moving into the second book (by Michael Jang).  The presentation in this book has a different feel, maybe a little broader and less exacting.  The organization of this section in the first book seemed clearer, but maybe that is just because that is how I first encountered the information.  I wonder if I had done the books in the other order I would have molded my brain into the shape of this book first and found the other one odd.  It is not bad though.  I appreciate the sidebar tips I'm seeing like "this file used to be located here but in version 7 they have moved it there"  Also Jang talks some about the MLS mode, unlike in the other book.  He doesn't focus on it but at least acknowledges it is there and gives you a signpost to say "if you want more look that way" before continuing on.</p>
    
    <p>Another new bit of info, the enforcing/permissive setting is actually an instance in the wider boolean settings as opposed to being some other type of thing.</p>
    
    <p>There is also a section on defining user roles that the other book skipped over.  The author here says that this is not on the exam but still good to know.  While I appreciate the other book's focus on exam content, I like these other bits because they help round out my understanding of the environment.</p>
    
    <h2>2018-09-14</h2>
    <p>Went to the first offline linux meetup.  It seems that the group has been inactive for a while and that this was the first meeting of the resumed group.  The format was mostly a presentation-type meeting, and there were speakers on two topics.  The first gave some background on Git's internals, and then moved on to talk about some of the more interesting/advanced features and there was some discussion about how to use these and also people sharing their experiences/pitfalls/problems/solutions using this tool in teams.  There was also a mention of a freely available book called Pro Git (https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) that is supposed to be a very good reference.</p>
    
    <p>It felt like most of the people in the room were ahead of me in their experience with this tool, as in my previous job the company had used a subversion based tool, so I did not have many stories to contribute on the topic.  It was interesting though hearing the variety of ways people use it and how things like numbering were problems that they dealt with differently.  Also it was reassuring to hear that while there are really complex workflows out there that have been built around Git, most people seem to be using it with a more simple workflow for the branching, keeping changes close to the main trunk.  One of the reasons I chose to host this Journal in github pages was so I could get some practice using Git, checking things in and out and so forth, so it was nice to hear some more about the tool and to learn about a good (and free) reference resource.</p>
    
    <p>The second talk moved us into a bigger room since more people arrived than there were chairs.  (The building was very nice by the way.  It was held in a training facility that was really set up well for presentations in terms of chairs, screens, and so on.)  This talk was on SSH, which is something I use fairly regularly but was not boring as the speaker quickly got into some of the cooler features that I've heard about but not tried much myself like X forwarding and mapping to ports on remote machines and so on.  It was helpful seeing a live demonstration of some of those things I had only read about.  After that was completed, there was some talk about how the subsequent meetups could go and what topics people were interested in.  Up to that point it was a little intimidating how so many people in the room were doing this stuff professionally every day at a very competent level, but when they asked it turned out there were just as many beginners there too, so that helped put me more at ease.  It always seems with this stuff like the more that I learn, it also increases x10 my awareness of how much stuff there is out there that I don't know.  It helps seeing that there are other people out there on the same journey.</p>
    
    <p>That is about all for this entry, just hoping my work schedule works out good so that I can attend again next month.  Thanks Linux Academy who is sponsoring the sessions!</p>
    
    <h2>2018-09-12 - Second Session</h2>
    <p>Today I spent more time off-book searching and reading about questions that came up that weren't explained in the book's material.  The book is good, but very focused on exam material so I had to look outside for some other sources to get a little more context about concepts that weren't explained in the book.</p>
    
    <p>The remainder of the book material dealt with two concepts.  The first was booleans which are predefined sets of policy features that can be quickly turned on and off.  These policy groups can be toggled temporarily or more permanently with some simple commands.  There are a lot of these, but one of the status commands at least gives a nice description as to what they do.  Searching through those descriptions would let a person narrow down at least to a few sets of policies dealing with the area they are interested in.  I suspect this is more commonly used than the individual tags.  I need to look and see if there is a way to map these boolean policy groups to individual tags.</p>
    
    <p>The second concept was about diagnosing and addressing policy violations.  It described how to find SELinux entries in the log, as well as a troubleshooting package that writes additional information to /var/log/messages.  Somehow they don't print out as nicely in my terminal as they do in the book.  At the start of the text blob is a message saying to run sealert -l [some uuid] to get complete information.  Running this gives a much nicer-formatted output along with additional info to what is in the book listing.</p>
    
    <p>Outside the book one of the questions that I looked into was the s0 entries at the end of each label.  It turns out that they are called sensitivity levels and there is another type as well called category levels (they look like s0, s3, c0, c3, etc.)  Still after reading that I was unclear on what they do, as the document mentioned they were involved with some things called MLS and MCS.  After digging some more I see that they are used for two different enhancement packages for SELinux called MCS and MLS, which stand for Multi Category Security and Multi Level Security.  So this explains why all these basic exercises show s0 for everything since the material that I'm looking at doesn't involve these packages.</p>

    </ul>
    
    <p>Another item that I looked into was the question of how these labels interact with remote shares like NFS.  How, in that situation do two different systems manage their labels?</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/selinux_users_and_administrators_guide/sect-security-enhanced_linux-working_with_selinux-mounting_file_systems">https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/selinux_users_and_administrators_guide/sect-security-enhanced_linux-working_with_selinux-mounting_file_systems</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>They mention:<br/>
    "In this example, server:/export/web is mounted locally to the /local/web/ directory, with all files being labeled with the httpd_sys_content_t type, allowing Apache HTTP Server access. server:/export/database is mounted locally to /local/database/, with all files being labeled with the mysqld_db_t type, allowing MariaDB access. These type changes are not written to disk."</p>
    <p>So sounds like the labeling is perhaps not written back to the file on an nfs share?  Need to find some more sources of information on this.</p>

    <p>Finally, I came across this talk on SELinux from Red Hat's Thomas Cameron.  I've been to some of his talks before and he's a great presenter, so need to watch this one and see if he has any additional insights or comes at it from another angle <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNoVgDqqJmM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNoVgDqqJmM</a></p>

    <p>Generally I've been noticing that when I have a question about how some aspect of it works or relates, the Red Hat documentation has been where I ultimately find the answer.  Not always in the place or under the heading I expect or first seem to look, but the documentation does seem to be very good.</p>

    
    <h2>2018-09-05 - First Session Progress</h2>
    <p>Today I read through the first few sections of the van Vugt book.  Covered some definitions, how to enable/disable the whole SELinux system, both temporarily and from startup.  Next was a more in-depth look at context settings including how to view them, the notation of what they mean, how to change the type tags in the policy and applying that policy to the files which takes the tags defined in the policy and sets them in the files.</p>
    <p>The content so far focused more on setting the type tags than listing the different type tags and what they mean, but did include some info about looking up the different ones in man.  I may need to go looking for some list of the most common ones or something like that to get familiar with at least some key subset and get an idea about how they are classified.</p>
    <p>Another thing I need to look up is what the :s0 notation is at the end of the context label.  It is there in all of the examples but not really explained as he is staying focused on the type tags, so I need to look that up.</p>
    <p>One unexpected offshoot was in one of the exercises he has us use the elinks browser which is apparently an offshoot of lynx.  Years ago I wanted to get comfortable with lynx but the version packaged with my system had problems running.  Elinks seems to run fine though, so I can keep that around to play with later.</p>
    <p>At the end of the section a question that bothered me was where are all these labels stored, which could be important when it comes to things like backing up.  That led me to find this discussion where someone was wondering the same thing regarding SELinux and rsync: <a href="https://forums.fedoraforum.org/showthread.php?276028-SELinux-how-where-labels-stored-securing-rsync-backup">https://forums.fedoraforum.org/showthread.php?276028-SELinux-how-where-labels-stored-securing-rsync-backup</a></p>
    <p>The takeaway for my question was that the labels are stored with the file as an attribute.  The discussion also had a good point about what those labels mean when it comes to the backup/storage system which may require a different policy.  That leads to the question of policy storage which I found some answers to here: <a href="https://www.centos.org/docs/5/html/Deployment_Guide-en-US/rhlcommon-chapter-0001.html">https://www.centos.org/docs/5/html/Deployment_Guide-en-US/rhlcommon-chapter-0001.html</a> That page described the locations where the policy information is stored.  Given the Van Vugt book's emphasis on the policy being the master I think it would make the most sense to back up both the files and the policy, and not treat the labels on the files as definitive, but instead reapply the policy after a restore.  That would also allow a different policy to be applied on the backup storage server.</p>
