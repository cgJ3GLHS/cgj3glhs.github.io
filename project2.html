     <h2>2108-10-03</h2>
     <p>Today officially starts project #2.  For the first half hour or so I read through the other journals to get the assigned reviews out of the way so that I don't forget them.</p>
     
     <p>Next, I started working on sorting out my info sources.  Over the last few weeks I've been keeping an eye out for info and found several types of things from papers to web sites to books which I have been gathering together.  Going through those I discovered that the "print to pdf" technique that I had been using to stash the info did not work on some of the more overwrought web sites, so I had to go back and track them down again.  Putting this stuff in order and fleshing out the initial "establishing the project" entry with the URLs and other info took another couple of hours.</p>
     
     <p>Now as that's done I'm reading through the docs and noting down the different types of joints I see.  Overall they are falling into classifications along two dimensions.</p>
     
     <p>The first is based on the orientation of the pieces being joined to one another.  Here I see three broad categories:<br>
       <ul>
         <li>parallel</li>
         <li>right angles/T-joints</li>
         <li>angled joints (for example in roof trusses)</li>
       </ul>
     </p>
     
     <p>The second is more about the type of material used in the connection.
       <ul>
         <li>Lashing</li>
         <li>Peg/Notch/Key</li>
         <li>Carve and Bend</li>
         <li>Bolts</li>
         <li>Metal Joiners - Clamps, Hubs, Brackets</li>
         <li>Plywood Brackets (w/bolts)</li>
       </ul>
       Lashing is the most traditional means of making joints, and has an advantage of not requiring holes/cuts that weaken the material.  It also seems to be frequently used as reinforcement for other the other non-bolted types of joints.
     </p>
     
     <p>The peg/notch/key methods involve cutting notches that make the pieces fit together, inserting pegs to reinforce the lashing, or smaller pieces that act as bracing.  A lot of these techniques rely on wedges to tighten things together.</p>
     
     <p>The carve and bend methods involve leaving a long strip between nodes of a culm and wrapping it around another piece then lashing it back together.  This can only be done with green bamboo as dried bamboo won't be able to bend.</p>
     
     <p>There are also a lot of "modern" type connectors that are specifically made for bamboo, with special brackets/hubs, etc. that are made to fit into the ends of the pieces to connect them together.</p>
     
     <p>For this project I'll be focusing on the lashing and peg/notch/key methods, as my pieces are not green, and I don't want to buy a bunch of specialized metal joining bits.</p>
     
     <p>The bamboo pieces are already here, though I may need to buy some more if I want to do every type of joint.  Perhaps I could reuse some of them though if I take a picture and then undo the lashing to make the next one.  Also, I ordered some stronger line from amazon last weekend as the cord I had at home wasn't really right for this sort of thing.  That should be arriving tomorrow along with a book.</p>
     
     <p>After making the list of types I started making sketches of the details on how the joints go together, and got three of those done.  I may need to expand my info search to include different specific knot tying techniques as some of my sources are thin on those details.</p>
     
     <h2>2018-09-15</h2>
     <p>This weekend was the state bamboo society's 2-day event at the botanical garden.  On Saturday I was working so only arrived at the very end of the day.  The character of the event was very different from the meetup for project 1.  This was set up more with tables where people were selling bamboo-related crafts and things, along with various bamboo plants.  The environment was less classroom-like and more casual so it was easier to talk to a few of the people there.</p>
     
     <p>One guy who I talked to was especially helpful.  He had a really comprehensive book that listed each genus/species of bamboo along with its properties like height, circumference, color, and so on, along with information about nurseries across the country and which species they carry.  He was also able to answer a lot of the questions that I had about growing and caring for the plants.  I'd like to grow some of the really big ones, but would need to have them in containers for a few years, so I asked about how practical that was.  We talked about containers, trimming for height, and how to divide the plant into smaller segments when it starts to need more space.  He also had a lot of suggestions about the different species that would best fit my purposes, going through the book and circling different ones, pointing out their advantages and disadvantages.  While the external "craft-sale" appearance of the event made it feel at first that maybe it was not quite what I was looking for, talking to the people there and learning about the information they had to share was really a lot more valuable than what I had expected.</p>
     
     <p>On Sunday I went back and spent a little more time out in the garden looking at the different types of bamboo they had growing there, as well as the places where they had used it in fences, gates, and so on.  Unfortunately most of applications it had been put to in the garden were decorative as opposed to structural.  Indoors I talked to one guy who made flutes and he told me some about the process.  I was especially curious how he knocked out the sectional dividers on the inside, as I had read that same process was needed for one of the curing techniques.  Finally I bought four sections of pole to use for the joints, and I can cut them into smaller pieces if more are needed.</p>
     
     <h2>2018-09-15 - Establishing The Project - Structural Bamboo Joints</h2>
    <p>The second project is the physical world one.  For this project I'll be learning about how to make different kinds of structural joints for bamboo construction.  I've been interested in bamboo as a building material because it can be strong, lightweight and renewable.  There are a lot of differences between the structure of bamboo and regular timber that make the more mainstream timber joining techniques inappropriate.  While bamboo can be processed into composite materials that behave more like dimensional lumber, I'm more interested in learning about the types of joints that can be done without that sort of industrial processing, instead just using handheld tools.</p>
