     <h2>2018-09-15</h2>
     <p>This weekend was the state bamboo society's 2-day event at the botanical garden.  On Saturday I was working so only arrived at the very end of the day.  The character of the event was very different from the meetup for project 1.  This was set up more with tables where people were selling bamboo-related crafts and things, along with various bamboo plants.  The environment was less classroom-like and more casual so it was easier to talk to a few of the people there.</p>
     
     <p>One guy who I talked to was especially helpful.  He had a really comprehensive book that listed each genus/species of bamboo along with its properties like height, circumfrence, color, and so on, along with information about nurseries across the country and which species they carry.  He was also able to answer a lot of the questions that I had about growing and caring for the plants.  I'd like to grow some of the really big ones, but would need to have them in containers for a few years, so I asked about how practical that was.  We talked about containers, trimming for height, and how to divide the plant into smaller segments when it starts to need more space.  He also had a lot of suggestions about the different species that would best fit my purposes, going through the book and circling different ones, pointing out their advantages and disadvantages.  While the external "craft-sale" appearance of the event made it feel at first that maybe it was not quite what I was looking for, talking to the people there and learning about the information they had to share was really a lot more valuable than what I had expected.</p>
     
     <p>On Sunday I went back and spent a little more time out in the garden looking at the different types of bamboo they had growing there, as well as the places where they had used it in fences, gates, and so on.  Unfortunately most of applications it had been put to in the garden were decorative as opposed to structural.  Indoors I talked to one guy who made flutes and he told me some about the process.  I was especially curious how he knocked out the sectional dividers on the inside, as I had read that same process was needed for one of the curing techniques.  Finally I bought four sections of pole to use for the joints, and I can cut them into smaller pieces if more are needed.</p>
     
     <h2>2018-09-15 - Establishing The Project - Structural Bamboo Joints</h2>
    <p>The second project is the physical world one.  For this project I'll be learning about how to make different kinds of structural joints for bamboo construction.  I've been interested in bamboo as a building material because it can be strong, lightweight and renewable.  There are a lot of differences between the structure of bamboo and regular timber that make the more mainstream timber joining techniques inappropriate.  While bamboo can be processed into composite materials that behave more like dimensional lumber, I'm more interested in learning about the types of joints that can be done without that sort of industreal processing, instead just using handheld tools.</p>
